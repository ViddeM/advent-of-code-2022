# Day of advent of code
To run the program, ensure that the correct environment variables are included

## Environment variables
The available environment variables are:
 - part: Which part to run, either `part1` or `part2`
 - test_file: A test input data file to use (overrides normal input file)

## Examples
`part="part1" cargo run`
`part="part2" cargo run`
`part="part1" test_file="test.txt" cargo run`
